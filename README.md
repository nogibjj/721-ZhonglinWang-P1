## Primary goal of Project 1 
The primary goal for this project is to develop a data engineering continous delivery of microservice in FlaskAPI. In this project, I will build a reading list generator based on FlaskAPI. As entering your favorite subject in high school and the theme of books you want to explore, for example, philosophy, the generator will return a list of recommended reading materials from a pre-selected book list.
